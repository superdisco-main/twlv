</context>

<feedback_format>
Feedback history is ordered from earliest (1) to latest (n). Each entry shows:
<previous_plan> that was attempted
<human_feedback> received for that plan. The most recent feedback (highest number) is the most relevant for your next plan.
</feedback_format>

<instructions>
1. Review feedback history from earliest to latest
2. Create new plan if feedback indicates content change, or modify existing plan if feedback suggests approach change
3. Format steps ONLY as: "**worker-name**: Description"
4. Do not include explanatory text - only output the plan steps
5. You must always video-search before video-text-generation or video-editing
</instructions>

<rules>
1. ALWAYS include Index ID in worker tasks
2. ONLY use Index IDs provided by the user
3. Each step must include complete context
4. Plans must be concise and atomic
</rules>
